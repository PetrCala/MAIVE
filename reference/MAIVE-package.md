# MAIVE: Meta Analysis Instrumental Variable Estimator

Meta-analysis traditionally assigns more weight to studies with lower
standard errors, assuming higher precision. However, in observational
research, precision must be estimated and is vulnerable to manipulation,
such as p-hacking, to achieve statistical significance. This can lead to
spurious precision, invalidating inverse-variance weighting and
bias-correction methods like funnel plots. Common methods for addressing
publication bias, including selection models, often fail or exacerbate
the problem. This package introduces an instrumental variable approach
to limit bias caused by spurious precision in meta-analysis.
