Description: 
    Meta-analysis traditionally assigns more weight to studies with lower standard errors, 
    assuming higher precision. However, in observational research, precision must be 
    estimated and is vulnerable to manipulation, such as p-hacking, to achieve statistical 
    significance. This can lead to spurious precision, invalidating inverse-variance 
    weighting and bias-correction methods like funnel plots. Common methods for addressing 
    publication bias, including selection models, often fail or exacerbate the problem. 
    This package introduces an instrumental variable approach to limit bias caused by 
    spurious precision in meta-analysis.
